  ARCHIVED SECTION: Featured Vehicles / Highlight-Fahrzeuge
  ============================================================================
  
  Archived Date: 2025-01-XX
  Reason: Removed redundant section - functionality merged into main Fahrzeuge section
          Main section now shows "top-offer" vehicles first by default
  
  Original Location: index.html (between Fahrzeuge and Blog sections)
  Original Section ID: featured-vehicles
  
  DEPENDENCIES:
  - CSS: .featured-section, .featured-grid classes in styles.css
  - JavaScript: loadFeaturedVehicles() function in scripts.js
  - API: Uses same vehicle API endpoint as main Fahrzeuge section
  
  HOW TO RESTORE:
  1. Copy this section back into index.html after the Fahrzeuge section
  2. Uncomment loadFeaturedVehicles() call in scripts.js (around line 777)
  3. Ensure featured-grid element exists for vehicle rendering
  4. Test that featured vehicles load correctly
  
  NOTE: The loadFeaturedVehicles() function still exists in scripts.js but is
        commented out for potential future use.
